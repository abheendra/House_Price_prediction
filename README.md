# House_Price_prediction

Hi Friends!
This project was done through Google Colab. 
The main aim of the project is to predict the house price in Chennai city of India, based on an the available datasets. Two situations were taken, wherein, in the first one, only the Built up area of the house was given and in the second dataset, several features were given like Area, Distance from Main Road, Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc. 
Hence, we have provided a solution to predict the House price in both the above situations - A univariate Model and a Multivariate Machine Learning Model.
In case, you would like to predict the house price for a different city or country, you would have to find a dataset, containing the House price and then train the model. All you would have to do is, change the path of your dataset.
